I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be a game developer, and this was my first attempt at creating one.
I started using RPG Maker VX Ace, which was really fun!
It helped me develop stories for my characters,
<a href=../fursona>Caroline</a>, Violet, and Ashley (my fictional family).</p><h2 id=characters>Characters</h2><p>(cont. from <a href=../fursona#My_First_Game>Fursona: My First Game</a>)</p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t too much of a problem for the game though, because I had been thinking up two
more characters for years.
I have a fantasy of being a mother of two girls.
In this fantasy, one is a teen, named Violet (Vi),
and the other is a child, named Ashley (Ash).
These sisters would have a friendly rivalry between them, with Vi being the good counterpart
to Ashley&rsquo;s wicked evil.
Having an &ldquo;evil&rdquo; child seemed like a fun idea to me.</p><h2 id=plot>Plot</h2><p>A loose version of the intended plot of the game goes like this:</p><p>Caroline, Violet, and Ashley set out in search of adventure</p><p>Ashley is tricked into becoming a villain</p><p>The rest of the family sets out to find a way to stop her from doing X generic evil thing,
and bring her to her senses, so they can return to being a normal family.</p><h2 id=world>World</h2><p>The world of Basuoland is supposed to be filled with anthropomorphic characters just like
the main characters. As you might have guessed, the game is named after the setting.</p><p>&ldquo;Basuoland&rdquo; is a made up word coming from the root for &ldquo;animal&rdquo; in some dead language,
like any English word usually does. I think I swapped around the &ldquo;u&rdquo; and &ldquo;o&rdquo; to make
it unsearchable online at the time too, for recognition, so people would know it was
my idea. That was my main goal for the name, since I eventually want the game to be
marketable.</p><h2 id=closing>Closing</h2><p>I eventually stopped using RPG Maker, for one reason or another,
and the project was doomed to stop when my free trial ran out anyway.</p><p>One day, I hope to continue this project, using the ideas I came up with back then,
and probably a custom game engine, since I like to make those, a lot.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
