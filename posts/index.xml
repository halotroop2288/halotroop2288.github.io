Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Caroline! I&amp;rsquo;m a non-binary trans woman who makes Minecraft mods, professionally tests video games, and (tries) to make them.
My pronouns are She/Her, or They/Their/Them. But I&amp;rsquo;d prefer if you&amp;rsquo;d just not refer to me indirectly, where possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
